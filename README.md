# a little bit of style, please

A fork of [no style, please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) with a few differences I wanted for myself.

## things I changed
* Code blocks have horizontal scroll instead of wrapping.
* url_out on menu opens links in a new tab

## things I want to change
* add syntax highlight to codeblocks
